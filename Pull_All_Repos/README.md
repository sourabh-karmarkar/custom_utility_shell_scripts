You can create a shell script to loop through all the folders in your current directory, check if they are Git repositories, and if so, attempt to pull from the current branch. The git_pull_all_repos.sh script accomplishes this task and logs the results to a text file:

Save this script to a file (e.g., `git_pull_all_repos.sh`) and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x git_pull_all_repos.sh
```

To run the script, execute it in your terminal:

```bash
./git_pull_all_repos.sh
```

This script will go through all subdirectories in your current directory, check if they are Git repositories, and if they are, attempt to pull from the current branch. The results will be logged in the `git_pull_all_repos.txt` file, including "Success" or "Error" for each repository.
